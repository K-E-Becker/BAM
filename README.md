# `BAM` - Binary Adding Machine

## Concept

In the book called "Code" by Charles Petzold, the author discusses building a binary adding machine with lightbulbs and switches using relays. I was sitting in the hot sun, on break from the last stretch of my bootcamp, thinking that I could TOTALLY do this in code. How though? First I had to decide in what technology. My first thought was React. Ive one my last few projects in React. It felt easy, familiar, with an simply UI. Therefore...it would not do. I wanted this project to take me back to my basics. React was too simple. I needed JAVASCRIPT! Then how to render a front end? Clearly the DOM! ... I think the sun was a little too hot. However, I wanted to do something that I hadnt done recently. I wanted to push myself and review the basics of my bootcamp at the same time. This felt perfect. A concept that, at its core, is one of the fundamentals of coding, utilizing one fo the fundamental skills of my coding experience. I was going to make a binary adding maching in javascript.
